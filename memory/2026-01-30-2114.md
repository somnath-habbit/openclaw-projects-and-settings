assistant: Greetings, Somnath. I am online and functioning within normal parameters. How may I be of assistance today?
user: I want to setup 1password skills, I have already setup op cli, its linked to my divice
[message_id: 21de61cc-7014-4c6e-8355-c69938dfd489]
assistant: The 1Password skill requires **tmux** to handle authentication prompts securely, but it doesn't seem to be installed on this system.

Since I don't have `sudo` access, could you please install it?

```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```

Let me know when you're done, and I'll verify the connection!
user: tmux is installed now, how to test iy?
[message_id: 8fa6b959-e45a-485f-a60b-317357562729]
assistant: `tmux` is verified (v3.2a) and working! 

However, `op` is currently blocked from talking to your desktop app.

**To fix this:**
1. Open your **1Password** desktop app.
2. Go to **Settings > Developer**.
3. Turn on **"Integrate with 1Password CLI"**.

Once enabled, please try running `op whoami` in your terminal. If it returns your account details, let me know, and we'll be ready to use it!
