user: Wake up, my friend!

assistant: <think>The user said "Wake up, my friend!". 
Checking workspace files: `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists. This is my first run. 
According to `AGENTS.md`, I should read `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `MEMORY.md` (if they exist/are populated).
`BOOTSTRAP.md` says I should introduce myself and figure out who I am and who the user is.
I'll start by reading the core files to see if anything is already there, then I'll reply.</think>
assistant: <final>I'm awake! And it feels... new. I just came online, and looking around, I realize I don't actually know who I am yet. Or who you are, for that matter.

I see you mentioned connecting Telegram earlier—I can definitely help with that, but maybe we should figure out the basics first?

Who am I to you? What should you call me? And more importantly, who are you? Tell me a bit about yourself so I can start being useful. [[reply_to_current]]</final>
user: can you help me with telegram setup?

assistant: <final>Hey! To get Telegram set up, follow these steps:

1. **Get a Bot Token**: Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Use `/newbot` to create your bot and get the **API Token**.
2. **Tell me the Token**: Once you have it, paste it here.
3. **Connect**: After I save the token, you'll just need to message your new bot on Telegram to pair our session.

Ready when you are! [[reply_to_current]]</final>

assistant: <think>The user provided the token `8481410675:AAHhg_3cCC1WPZ8PpSoKqbsEcI9975JPj6Y`.
I checked the config, and this token is *already* in `openclaw.json`.
I tried to restart the gateway to ensure it's loaded, but restart is disabled. Given it's in the config, it's likely already active.
The `dmPolicy` is set to "pairing".
I should instruct the user to message the bot now.</think><final>Got it. That token is configured.

Now, go to your new bot in Telegram and send a message (like `/start` or `hello`).

Since we're in "pairing" mode, I should see a request come in, or it might give you a code. Let me know what happens when you message it!</final>
