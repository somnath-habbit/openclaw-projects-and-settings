[message_id: 109]
assistant: <think>
</think><final>Hi Somnath! 💠

I'm currently overseeing the **LinkedIn discovery phase**. 

The scraper is working through search offsets to build our application queue. I'm also preparing the upgrade for the `ApplicationBot`'s screening logic so it can handle those technical experience questions automatically once the discovery batch is ready.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to look into while the scraper runs?</final>
user: [Telegram Somnath Ghosh id:8275674189 2026-02-03 17:30 GMT+5:30] Are we connected?

</think><final>We are fully connected. 💠

I've been monitoring the background processes and performing internal maintenance. Your **AutoJob Control Center** is live, and I am currently troubleshooting the LinkedIn scraper to ensure it can efficiently scan and save the 200 roles you requested.

I'm standing by—how would you like to proceed?</final>

}
assistant: <final>The gateway has successfully restarted following the configuration update. 💠

I have performed a post-restart audit:
*   **User Control Center**: The Flask UI is up and running (PID 290574).
*   **Database Health**: Verified. We currently have **47 jobs** indexed. 
*   **Queue Status**: There are no jobs currently awaiting cover letter generation or resume tailoring.
*   **Background Tasks**: The previous scraper sessions were cleared during the restart.

I'm standing by for your next instruction—should we initiate a fresh 200-job discovery scan using our refined offset logic?</final>
user: So which model are you using?
